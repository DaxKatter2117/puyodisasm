# Puyo Puyo 1 Megadrive/Genesis Disassembly
This is a WIP Disassembly of Puyo Puyo 1 for the Megadrive/Genesis    
I'm still quite new to game disassembly so suggestions, pull requests, and the like are all welcome!    
## Building
Download the Repo from github and run build.bat.  This will build the rom and place it in the repo as puyobuilt.bin
## Todo (In order of priority):
- Make the Game Shiftable
- Document all of the game data
- Convert Binary ASM includes into binary includes
- Store Art Data in the repo as uncompressed, and compress the files on build
- Document Game Code
- Decompile Sound Driver
## Stretch Goals:
- Allow building the Arcade (Japan) Release
- Allow building the Arcade (World) Release
- Allow building the Sharp X68000 Release
